<text>recognize the security concerns when building web services</text>
<instructionalPlan>Begin by discussing the security implications of web services at a high level and move into a brief discussion of the approaches to security in applications and how it can sometimes be an afterthought - as opposed to a process - and summarize the differences between each approach. Make sure to explain what an integrated approach is and why it is required. (Source 1, section: Security and XML Web Services, up to but not including Key Security Concerns)  |n  |n Then explore the main security concerns that developers need to have when building web services. This includes |n  - authentication |n  - authorization |n  - auditing and logging |n  - integrity (also see Source 3 for a bit more info on integrity) |n  - encryption |n You could use an Explore List or Explore Graphic for this discussion.  |n (Source 1, Section: Key Security Concerns up to and including the sentence "The encrypted data can be placed in a message, such as a message exchanged via SOAP, or it can be stored." in section: Encryption and Related Techniques) |n  |n  |b Note to writer: |p  The topic is simply providing a high level overview here and doesn't need to get into the ins and out of encryption etc. |n  |n  |b Practice: |p  Variation of test.</instructionalPlan>
<strategy>Two MXYs asking the learner to identify security concerns when building web services. Options are statements describing security concerns. |n Attributes: |n  - authentication |n  - authorization |n  - auditing and logging |n  - integrity |n  - encryption</strategy>

<instructionalPlan>As a counterpoint to the security concerns raised, discuss the major web service security standards in use.  |n  - Begin with WS-Security SOAP messaging, making sure to note that this is an OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) standard (http://www.oasis-open.org/standards). Also mention that WS-Security is seen as a foundation to build upon and list and describe the other related standards. (Source 2, section: Web Service Security Standards and Specifications up to but not including WS-Trust)  |n  |n  - Move on to explore the various parts of the WS-Security family, which are all OASIS standards, including: |n  |w |w |w WS-Trust |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-Federation |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-SecureConversation |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-SecurityPolicy and the WS-Policy Framework |w  |n (Source 2, Section: WS-Trust up to but not including SAML) |n  |n  |b Practice: |p  Matching question asking the learner to match descriptions (options) to web service security standards (targets). |n Targets: |n  |w |w |w WS-Security |n  |w |w |w WS-Trust |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-Federation |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-SecureConversation |w  |n  |b Note to writer: |p  I haven't listed WS-SecurityPolicy and the WS-Policy Framework as a target here or in the test, as the source doesn't seem to clearly differentiate between the two. |n  |n  - Also discuss these security standards, which are OASIS standards, but not part of the WS-Security family: |n  |w |w |w Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) (Source 2, Section: SAML) |n  |w |w |w eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) (Source 2, Section: XACML) |n  |n  - Finally, discuss these W3C security standards: |n  |w |w |w XML Signature |n  |w |w |w XML Encryption |n (Source 2, Section: XML Signature up to the end of the page) |n  |n  |b Practice: |p  Matching question asking the learner to match descriptions (options) to web service security standards (targets). |n Targets: |n  |w |w |w SAML |n  |w |w |w XACML |n  |w |w |w XML Signature |n  |w |w |w XML Encryption</instructionalPlan>
<text>describe the major web service security standards</text>
<strategy>Two Matching questions asking the learner to match descriptions (options) to web service security standards (targets). |n Question 1 targets: |n  |w |w |w WS-Security |n  |w |w |w WS-Trust  |n  |w |w |w XML Signature |n  |w |w |w XML Encryption |n  |n Question 2 targets: |n  |w |w |w WS-Federation |w  |n  |w |w |w WS-SecureConversation |w  |n  |w |w |w SAML |n  |w |w |w XACML</strategy>
